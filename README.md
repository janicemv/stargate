# Stargate

Stargate is a database-driven web application for cataloging and exploring stars and constellations. Built using **Laravel**, **Blade**, **Tailwind**, and **MySQL**, the project aims to provide a structured and searchable system for celestial objects, including astronomical, astrological, and mythological/spiritual insights.

## Features

- üåü **Star Database** ‚Äì Stores detailed information about stars, including multiple names, astronomical data, and magical correspondences.
- üî≠ **Constellations** ‚Äì Connect stars to their constellations, historical references and official IAU information.
- üè∑Ô∏è **Keywords** ‚Äì Link stars to relevant keywords and themes.
- üñºÔ∏è **Stellar Glyphs** ‚Äì Upload and manage stellar glyphs.
- üîç **Search** - By Constellation, Star name, Designation or HIP

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL
- **Frontend:** Blade, Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** SQL
- **Storage:** Local file storage for glyphs (with possible cloud integration)
- **Authentication:** Laravel Breeze (for API authentication)

## Add Info

- You will need to be a registered user to add info to the database.
- Each db entry is connected to the user. Users will be able to edit or delete their own data entrances.
- Every information added to the db needs to have its own reference. It can be personal opinion or impression, but this needs to be written.
- URL field optional to link the information to its reference.

## To be implemented

- Interactive tabs to choose between Astronomical and Magical information in Star pages
- Add view by Keyword
- Table and form to include data in the References page
- Suggestions/Report an error form
- Edit and delete information (if you were the user who added it)
- Moderation of db entrance (shows only approved info)
- Integration with email for real users registration
- Deployment of the website for public access
- Addition of other celestial objects
